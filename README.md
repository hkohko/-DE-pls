This bot is currently maintained and updated by myself. So updates/changes can take an hour or a month.

Actually useful warframe.market prices and other queries.

A simple Warframe (PC) Discord Bot
This bot uses warframe.market API and doc.warframestat.us API

I made this bot due to lack of these features on various existing warframe bots:

1. Actually useful warframe.market prices (and average prices) based on currently online/in-game players.
2. fuzzy search for all items, it's not perfect but typos are less punishing.
3. List all market items containing specified string(s), useful for mods like the Vigilante/Galvanized series.
4. Show basic weapon and warframe stats (armor, shields, damage, CC, CD, etc.)
5. Show mod drop locations.

Changes:  
`
v0.0.5 (18/05/2023): market queries now includes all platforms  
v0.1.0 (13/06/2023): improved search performance for all commands
